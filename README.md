# Git Account Manager

A cross-platform desktop app for managing Git profiles. Switch your Git identity, SSH config, and connected accounts in one click.

Built with **Tauri v2** (Rust) + **React** + **TypeScript** + **Tailwind CSS**.

## Features

- **Profiles** — Create, edit, and delete named accounts. Each profile can link **GitHub**, **GitLab**, or both.
- **One-click activation** — Activating a profile updates **global** `git config user.name` and `user.email`, and rewrites `~/.ssh/config` so SSH to **github.com** / **gitlab.com** uses that profile's key.
- **Default platform** — If both GitHub and GitLab are connected, choose which account supplies the active **git identity** (name/email).
- **OAuth sign-in** — **GitHub** via device code flow; **GitLab.com** via browser authorization and PKCE (local callback). OAuth app **Client / Application IDs** are configurable in Settings (with built-in defaults).
- **SSH keys** — Generate **Ed25519** keys with `ssh-keygen`, attach an existing key from `~/.ssh`, **upload** keys to GitHub/GitLab, and optionally **remove** keys from the host when deleting a profile.
- **System tray** — Closing the window hides the app; restore or quit from the tray menu.
- **Settings** — OAuth credentials, **launch at login** (autostart), and **light / dark / system** theme.

## Development

### Prerequisites

#### Node.js (v18+)

Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) or install via winget:

```bash
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS
```

#### pnpm

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

#### Rust & Cargo

**Windows:**

```bash
winget install Rustlang.Rustup --source winget
```

Or download the installer from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).

After install, make sure `cargo` is in your PATH. You may need to restart your terminal. Verify:

```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

If `cargo` is not found after install, add it to PATH manually:

```powershell
$env:Path = "$env:USERPROFILE\.cargo\bin;" + $env:Path
```

**macOS:**

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libappindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev patchelf
```

#### Git & ssh-keygen

Git must be installed and available in PATH (needed for `git config` and `ssh-keygen`).

```bash
git --version
ssh-keygen -V
```

### Install & Run

```bash
pnpm install
```

**Development**

| Target                                                         | Command            | Notes                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Web** (browser only, faster UI work; Tauri APIs unavailable) | `pnpm dev:web`     | Vite on [http://localhost:1420](http://localhost:1420)             |
| **Desktop** (full Tauri shell)                                 | `pnpm dev:desktop` | Same as `pnpm tauri dev`; starts the Vite dev server automatically |

### Build

| Target      | Command              | Output                                                               |
| ----------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Web**     | `pnpm build:web`     | Static files in `dist/`                                              |
| **Desktop** | `pnpm build:desktop` | Same as `pnpm tauri build`; runs `build:web` first, then Rust bundle |

Installers are generated under `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

### GitHub releases (CI)

Pushing a **version tag** triggers the [Build & Release](.github/workflows/build.yml) workflow: it builds installers for Windows, Linux, and macOS, then attaches them to a GitHub Release.

1. Bump the version consistently in `package.json`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, and `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`.
2. Commit and push those changes to `main` (or your default branch).
3. Create a tag whose name starts with **`v`** (the workflow only publishes on `refs/tags/v*`):

```bash
git tag v0.1.0   # same version as in tauri/package
git push origin v0.1.0
```

Pushes to `main` or pull requests still run the build jobs, but the **release** job runs **only** on a tag push like the above. If you run the workflow manually from the Actions tab, the release step is skipped for the same reason (the ref is a branch, not a tag).

**Preview production web build**

```bash
pnpm preview:web
```

### IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)

## Troubleshooting

### GitHub: `GitHub device code error: {"error":"Not Found"}`

This is returned when GitHub responds with an error to the **device authorization** request (`POST https://github.com/login/device/code`). The app shows the response body from GitHub; `Not Found` usually means GitHub does not accept the **Client ID** or the app is not set up for this flow.

**Typical causes and what to try**

| Situation                      | What to check / fix                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Wrong or unknown Client ID** | The ID in **Settings → GitHub OAuth** must match an existing [OAuth App](https://github.com/settings/developers) under your account (or org). Typos, extra spaces, or an app that was **deleted** produce this kind of error. Create a new OAuth App or restore the correct Client ID. |
| **OAuth App not created yet**  | Complete **New OAuth App** in GitHub Developer Settings before pasting the Client ID.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Device flow disabled**       | In the OAuth App settings on GitHub, enable **Device flow** (required for "Connect with GitHub"). Without it, authorization for this desktop flow may fail.                                                                                                                            |
| **Wrong app type**             | Use a **GitHub OAuth App**, not a **GitHub App**—their credentials and flows differ.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

After changing settings on GitHub, save the app, copy the Client ID again into this application, and retry **Connect with GitHub**.

### GitLab (browser): `Client authentication failed due to unknown client, no client authentication included, or unsupported authentication method.`

This appears on **GitLab's website** (URL like `gitlab.com/oauth/authorize?...`) immediately after you click **Connect with GitLab**, when the browser opens the authorization page. GitLab rejects the OAuth application before you can approve access.

**Typical causes and what to try**

| Situation                           | What to check / fix                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Wrong or unknown Application ID** | The value in **Settings → GitLab OAuth** must be the **Application ID** from your [GitLab application](https://gitlab.com/-/user_settings/applications) on **GitLab.com**. Typos, extra spaces, a **deleted** application, or an ID from another GitLab instance will trigger **unknown client**. Create a new application or copy the ID again from the correct app. |
| **Application not created yet**     | Finish **Add new application** on GitLab before pasting the Application ID (see in-app steps for redirect URI and scopes).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Confidential / auth method**      | This app uses a **public** client with PKCE (no client secret). On GitLab, leave **Confidential** **unchecked** when creating the application. A **confidential** app can lead to **unsupported authentication method** (or related failures) during token exchange because the flow does not send a client secret.                                                   |
| **Redirect URI or scopes**          | Set **Redirect URI** to `http://localhost:19847/callback` and enable the **api** scope, as shown in Settings. A mismatch can cause other OAuth errors; fix the application on GitLab to match.                                                                                                                                                                        |

After fixing the application on GitLab, click **Save Settings** in this app, then try **Connect with GitLab** again.

### GitLab: `error sending request for url (https://gitlab.com/oauth/token)`

After you click **Connect with GitLab**, the browser completes authorization and the app exchanges the authorization code for an access token by **POST**ing to `https://gitlab.com/oauth/token`. That message is returned when the HTTP client **cannot complete the request** (no response was received). It is a **transport** failure, not a wrong Client ID or redirect URI (those usually produce a different error after GitLab responds).

**Typical causes and what to try**

| Situation                    | What to check / fix                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **No route to the internet** | Confirm the machine can open [https://gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com) in a browser and that nothing is forcing offline mode.                                                                                                                                            |
| **DNS**                      | Ensure `gitlab.com` resolves (`nslookup gitlab.com` or ping). Corporate DNS or a broken hosts file can block the name.                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Firewall / proxy**         | Allow **outbound HTTPS** to `gitlab.com` (port 443). If you must use an HTTP(S) proxy, the app's Rust `reqwest` stack must see proxy settings (system env vars such as `HTTPS_PROXY` are often required for CLI/desktop tools on Windows).                              |
| **TLS / certificates**       | HTTPS inspection (corporate proxy, antivirus) can break TLS if a custom root is not trusted by the TLS stack the app uses (**rustls** + Mozilla root store in this project). Try without inspection, or install/trust the corporate root as required by your IT policy. |
| **VPN or split tunneling**   | Some VPNs block or misroute `gitlab.com`; disconnect or adjust split tunneling and retry.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **GitLab availability**      | Rare, but check [GitLab status](https://status.gitlab.com/) if everything else works in the browser.                                                                                                                                                                    |

**Quick checks**

1. In a terminal on the same PC: `curl -I https://gitlab.com/oauth/token` (or open the URL in a browser; you may get a method-not-allowed response—that still proves reachability).
2. Temporarily disable VPN / third-party firewall / HTTPS-scanning antivirus to see if the error disappears (then re-enable and narrow the exception).

**Note:** OAuth in this app targets **GitLab.com** (`gitlab.com`). Self-managed GitLab instances use different hostnames and are not covered by the built-in URLs.

## Future Improvements

- **Authentication options:** support SSH keys and personal access tokens.
- **Clipboard:** copy SSH public keys to the clipboard from the app.
- **Per-account keys:** view and manage SSH keys for each saved account.
- **Bitbucket:** connect **Bitbucket.org** from a profile, alongside GitHub and GitLab.
